# EEG/LFP Muller Pipelines

This is the formal documentation for the signal processing of various sources of raw EEG,LFP data in the Muller Lab. We have two pipelines, one for the Martinez-Trujillo Monkey Lab data, and one for the Clinical Recordings Epilepsy EEG data. The objective is to be able to take a series of raw data files from either of the pipelines (.ccf, .nev, .ns2, .ns6, etc), and systematically provide a roadmap to processing and loading these files into your MATLAB workspace, so that you can visualize and work with the data for your own project.
