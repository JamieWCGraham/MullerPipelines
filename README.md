# EEG/LFP Muller Pipelines

This is the formal documentation for the signal processing of various sources of raw EEG,LFP data. We have two pipelines, one for the Martinez-Trujillo Monkey Lab data, and one for the Clinical Recordings Epilepsy EEG data. The objective is to be able to take a series of raw data files from either of the pipelines (.ccf, .nev, .ns2, .ns6, etc), and systematically provide a roadmap to processing and loading these files into your MATLAB workspace, so that you can visualize and work with the data for your own project.

## Martinez-Trujillo Monkey Lab LFP Pipeline

This is the formal documentation for the signal processing of raw data from the intracranial electrode EEG recordings from the monkey lab (Martinez-Trujillo). 



## Clinical Recordings EEG Pipeline

This is the formal documentation for the signal processing of the intracranial EEG recording during hospitalization of epileptic patient.
